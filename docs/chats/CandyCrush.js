      review: `I'm an executive at a large, well-known corporation in the cryptocurrency & blockchain sector. Every day I make decisions regarding millions of dollars in assets, which involves a copius amount of number crunching, optimizations, and cost minimization. After a long hard day at work I want nothing more than to be absolutely goddamn reckless and to blow all my fucking money without having to make a single decision. This is where CandyCrush really shines. She tells me what to do, she takes all of my money, and I regularly blow my load all over my computer. Simple as that.`
