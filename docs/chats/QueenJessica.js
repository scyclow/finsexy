    go to casino and lose money
      "Okay, I'm in the casino right now. Just sat down at a slot machine"
      "Oops, I lost."





  - be a good little money slut


  - money only has value because you give it to me (taxes)



  - you are an inanimate object to me
  - you are a NPC

  - if talked to AI, mention relapsing

  - incorporate dialogue at bottom

  "You know, I have to admit... You're really fucking boring"

  "loser"

  Get cucked by vinceslickson/steviep. "They can provide me the pleasure that you never could because you're inadequate."; "he can make more money than you ever could"
    If woman: how does it feel to have a man make more than you?


  - let's keep something in mind: I don't owe you anything. You pay me compensation for having to talk to you. Consider it an "idiot tax". You're paying for the privilege ofspeaking to me
  - i'm in control of this conversation, not you

  You will completely lose everything. You will be in complete financial ruin. You will go bankrupt.
  You will take out loans because you're so desperate and obsesses. You will borrow money from people you love and care about.
  You'll take money away from your own future. Just to feed your findom addiction. You're sick. You know that.
  A tribute is a sign of respect and admiration
  Financial abuse gives you such a headrush. Such a spike in dopamine. All those happy chemicals.

It's too bad this stupid fucking website only accepts dogshit alt coins like Ethereum and FastCash. My whole portfolio is split between Bitcoin and Gold.

      review: `I'm sorry, I usually keep my mouth shut on websites like this, but the commenter above me is an absolute fucking moron with no understanding of history whatsoever. As Graeber clearly outlines in Debt: The First 5,000 Years, money as we know it is an invention of the state. Historical evidence suggests that gold only really has something that resembles a "market value" because states need a system in which they can pay soldiers and exert control over everyone else through tax collection. In fact, the evidence suggests that, despite the standard origins of money touted by mainstream economists, markets and casual barter only really came into existence after with widespread circulation of government-backed currency. Without it, we'd likely revert back to a proto-communisic society with a gift-based economiy`

    {
      review: `You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Human societies have been using various forms of currency for thousands and thousdands of years -- way before centralized states were a thing. Everyone knows that humans used seashells and sacred rocks as primative forms of currency before switching over to gold. And in the age of the internet, Bitcoin is largely poised to replace gold. But since one is physical value and the other is digital value I'm hedging my bets by owning a little bit of both. Anyhow, there are economists, like Ludwig Von Mises, who focus on this sort of thing. You should read an <em>actual</em> book on the topic every once in a while.`

      review: `Do you realize how stupid you sound when you talk? Von Mises is a fucking joke. The whole school of Austrian Economics is just armchair philosophizing. It's not like actual historical <em>evidence</em> is necessary to make claims or anything... If you actually read Graeber though (or any reputable anthropologist, for that matter) you'd see that all the forms of "primative currency" you mention were completely different from the sorts of market-based currency we know and use today. Those earlier forms of currency were mainly used to create, maintain, and reorganize relations between people. Iriquois wampum (which, I think is what you're referring to) wasn't used to buy cows and tools. It was used to arrange marriages, establish paternity, settle feuds, negotiate trible disputes, etc. Gold is just another completely arbitrary form of currency, which admittedly has certain properties that make it well suited for that purpose. But there's nothing "intrinsic" about it, or bitocin for that matter`
    },
    {
      review: `That's fucking bullshit and you know it. Gold is a better store of value than any other substance. It's durable, noncorrusive, malleable, infinitely divisible, and has been used for millennia as an expression of wealth. It's a social schelling point in which everyone has agreed that it has value. So if everyone agrees on it, then I hate to break it to you: it has fucking value!! And we're seeing the same thing with Bitcoin now. I'll buy as many cows and chickens as I want! Fucking deal with it bitch.`

If/when socity collapses we're just going to revert back to a communistic gift economy, and people will use whatever material is convenient and egalitarian for their social currencies. If you own all the gold no one is going to want to value something that arbitrarily gives you all the power. Value is a flexible concept`

And even if you could, MARKETS CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT ENFORCING PROPERTY RIGHTS!!! At least Ethereum has a robust smart contract system.

you know, the rise of monogmous relationships can be directly tied to capitalism and property ownership. Many early, pre-aggricultural societies were primarily matriarchal.

i want to talk about what i want to talk about.
in fact, if i ever so much as suspect that you're not paying attention and thoughtfully responding to every word i say, then i may stop responding to you all together.
