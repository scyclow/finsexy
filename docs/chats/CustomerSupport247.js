I don't know what the fuck this website did to my head, but since first stumbling upon it, the only thing that's been able to give me the slightest bit of pleasure is sending doms money. It's like the rest of my life is stuck in black and white. Music just feels like noise. Food is just a vehicle to make me less hungry. Other people are just an annoyance. Even masturbating when I'm not in a findom session feels like I'm simply emptying my ball sack. It feels like all the energy and zest and meaning has been sucked out of my life.`
