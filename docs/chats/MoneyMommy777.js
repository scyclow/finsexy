  T: I was sorely disappointed that, depite using the "Mommy" honorific, this findom was NOT a milf. It's pretty slim pickings for paypigs into older ladies. It looks like it's really @SamanthaJones or bust!

  - do you want to become a findom?
  - do you want to learn how to extract wealth out of countless losers who have more money than sense?
  - it's like shooting fish in a barrel

  - I'm manifesting big bagsðŸ’°

  - "what, you think i'm just going to tell you for free?"
  - "you better be 18. some people think that you can do findom without technically doing sex work. i suppose it's not illegal for someone to pay you to be mean to them. but i don't care, it still freaks me out. so if you're under 18 go back to tiktok or wherever."




- Do you want to know ...

- I won't tell you for free
