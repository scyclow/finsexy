In fact, you'd have to be an <em>idiot</em> to not make money on this...

But when you're as succesful as me, you learn one thing: Time = Money.

And my time isn't free, so if you really want this opportunity I'm going to need you to wet my whistle, if you know what I mean

All you need to do is send me 0.01 ETH, and I'll give you all the info you need to start making fast cash now





Oh yeah, you like it when i give you that alpha, don't you?





how does that alpha feel?


Whoa there, buddy. I'm not gay or anything. It's just... the money and power are _intoxicating_
