  vince: erroring out after ordering
  vince: maybe don't wet his whistle

  - give eth to vince, trust him to invest it on your behalf; sign something that says that you make him sole fiduciary, and it's a discretionary account, at his discretion.
    - oh, it just went up! don't take it out now
    - it jsut went down. better let me hold onto it. i need to protect you from yourself, and that's what daddy does.

  - alpha
    - new shitcoin?
    - pitch fastcash as alpha?
    - normally this would be a fincial security, but being on findom website gives us a perfect cover
    - i'm "selling" you a shit coin because it's your kink, got it?

    - make you beg "please give me some of your alpha, daddy"
  - dom type: role play

  - "i only sell at the top because i'm a top. you're a bottom. you're my exit liquidity. oh yeah, take all my liquidity"

Before I knew it I was in my early 30s and had absolutely zero relationship experience. I didn't even know where to start. The more I thought about it the more I tried to distract myself with work. But I could only distract myself so much. When I was fired in 2023 I felt like I'd lost everything. I watched everything I'd worked towards for my entire career spiral down the drain. It was all for nothing. I basically spent my entire adult life focused on my career -- working long nights and weekends, endlessly checking emails in my free time, you name it. I was an absolute slave to my job, and it didn't leave much time for a relationship. It was a lucrative decision, for sure, but it left me deeply unfilfilled. Without someone by my side to share my wins with and console me through my losses, it all felt meaningless. I constantly found myself asking: What's the point of it all? Then I found Vince. Vince taught me to completely block out all of that self doubt and get back to making money. Now I'm back on track and making more money than ever!`

I think it's because I have a suboptimal facial bone structure. Women really want a man like Vince. Not only does he have an optimal facial bone structure, but also he also has a very high level of charisma, and his monetary displays of status really seal the deal. I'm just hoping that I can pick up some of his charisma and make some money so I can finally engage in the sexually addictive lifestyle I've always dreamed of.`
