  - alpha
    - new shitcoin?
    - pitch fastcash as alpha?
    - normally this would be a fincial security, but being on findom website gives us a perfect cover
    - i'm "selling" you a shit coin because it's your kink, got it?

    - make you beg "please give me some of your alpha, daddy"
  - dom type: role play

  - "i only sell at the top because i'm a top. you're a bottom. you're my exit liquidity. oh yeah, take all my liquidity"



Testimonial
  "it makes me so hot watching vince get rich"
  "I just want to please my man. watching him take my money get's me sooo wet"
  "call me crazy, but i just don't get off on making money any more. i've been in crypto for years, and I guess all the volatile ups and downs just desensitized me or something. to get off i need a little something extra. that's why when vince put me into one of his 'investment producs' i came so goddamn hard. it was exactly what i needed"
  "On one hand I'm a complete degenerate sex addict, but on the other hand I can't find any women who want to have sex with me. I think it's because I have a suboptimal facial bone structure. Women really want a man like Vince. Not only does he have an optimal facial bone structure, but also he also has a very high level of charisma, and his monetary displays of status really seal the deal. I'm just hoping that I can pick up some of his charisma and make some money so I can finally engage in the sexually addictive lifestyle I've always dreamed of."
