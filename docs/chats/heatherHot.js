ETHICAL DOM RULES

  - just send a little bit to see how it feels


  - instead of linear help flow: "so what do you want to talk about?", then list options



https://www.reddit.com/r/findomsupportgroup/comments/18qvg29/i_try_to_be_an_ethical_domme_and_i_usually_have_a/





  - an hour or two after completing main dialogue
    - hey, i miss you. how've you been?
    - hehe, i've been thinking about it too
    - why don't you send me a little more, for old time's sake?
    - good boy/girl/<name>


  - even hotter when it's an onchain tx because then it on the public ledger. Everyone will know you're a dirty little pay pig for all eternityÂ

I went years without a single woman giving me a glimer of romantic or sexual attention. And believe me, it wasn't from lack of trying! I must have swiped right on every girl in my city, and I didn't get a single match. It was like I was completely invisible. Anyhow, meeting heather was like a breathe of fresh air. She's 100% worth every penny!`,

Am I attractive enough? Am I smart enough? Am I <em>good</em> enoough? Heather takes all the guesswork out of the equation. She tells me that she likes me for my money, I send her money, and she's happy. End of story. You don't find this sort of communication in IRL relationships. It really take a lot of the guesswork out of things!`
