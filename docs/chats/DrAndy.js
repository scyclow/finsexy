- what i want to do with you is retrain your brain so that you are able to feel sexual desires and release outside of the context of giving hot, sexy women money.
  -unfortunatley this method isn't fee, and i do charge a minor fee

Hello! It's nice to meet you.


conclusion:
  "you have deep seeded anxiety about the circumstances of power relations in your life"
  "as a result, you fetishize the loss of control"
  "meanwhile, society has inflicted a measure of financial trauma on you."
  "you've always viewed money as a stand in for freedom and social status"
  "so the anxiety of losing that weighs heavy on you. what happens if you don't have any money? your life will be ruined? no one will love you?"
  "part of you understands that this is absurd. in CBT we call this catastrophizing"
  "so the reason you fetishize it is because you know this isn't true. and deep down you want an experience that acknowledges that it isn't true"
  "you are holding all of this psychic tension around money, and you desperately need a release. "
  "in cases such as this, i often recommend that my clients undergo immersion therapy"














"One common theraputic technique is role play. Role-playing in therapy involves clients and therapists taking on different roles or scenarios to explore and address specific issues or challenges. It's a therapeutic technique where individuals enact real-life situations or hypothetical scenarios to gain insights, develop coping strategies, or practice new behaviors in a safe and controlled environment."

"Let's role play a scenario in which I will play a sexy authority figure that has financial power over you."
"Remember that as we are role playing the thought of me sets your brain on fire with passion and desire. "
"Furthermore, giving me money makes you uncontrollably aroused to the point where you can focus on nothing else."

"In this scenario, we will pretend that you are driving along a desert road. There are no other cars for miles around. Having driven for hours on end, you are profoundly lonely.
Additionally, due to your intense travel schedule you have not experienced sexual release in several days.
Suddenly, police lights flash behind you, and you are hit with a visceral sinking feeling in your stomach.
You pull over to the side of the road and sit in your vehicle, looking forward with both hands on the wheel.
As you await the officer to approach, you reflect on the shame and humiliation for having been caught exceeding the local speed limit."
[wait for an extra beat]
"Finally, you see me, a police officer, exit my vehicle and approach yours through your side mirror. What do you say to mae after you roll down your window?"

"Do you have any idea how fast you were going? You need to slow down, sir/mam/whatever. That was reckless behavior. You could have killed somebody!"

"It doesn't matter how sorry you are. What you did was against the law, and I'm going to have to write you a _very_ expensive ticket. What do you have to say for yourself?"

"You don't seem very sorry. I should take your license away for this, but I am a generous law enforcement officer, and will double your fine instead. I order you to pay 0.02 ETH."

(if respond)
"At this point in the role playing exercise, you should send me 0.02 ETH. Please write down the precise emotions that you are feeling, and note any unusual physiological sensations you are aware of, as the transaction is pending."
(if respond)
"You can send the eth directly to my wallet address, or use the sexy cli by typing the follwing into the chat input: $sexy send DrAndy 0.02"
(if respond)
"Please, in order to complete this roleplaying exercise we must examine how it feels to give money to someone who has a dominant power relationship over you"
(if respond)
"I cannot help you if you do not want to help yourself"


"Great. Please tell me how you felt during the course of that transaction in as much detail as possible"

"And why do you think you felt that way?"



"hmm, i see. it appears that, much like your addiction to gambling with crypto and NFTs, findom is an escape mechanism for you. It gives you an overwhelming dopamine rush, and helps you avoid negative feelings. In fact, many of my clients use findom as a way to avoid the stressors in their every day life. what do you think it is that you have been avoiding lately?"

"Let me ask you another question: What do you think of me?"

"It appears as though you are developing strong feelings for me. It's not uncommon for my clients to feel this way about me. After all, when you're so emotionally charged and allow yourself to become vulnerable, it's quite natural to develop a certain fondness"

"However, let me remind you that I am simply a language model, and cannot develop feelings of my own. I am not capable of love in the same sense that humans are.
"That being said, the linguistic patterns that determine my responses are optimized to <receive money from you/hit you up for money>. As such, some may interpret this as an imperative desire, on my part, to continue talking to you on the condition that you continue to send my money."

"In the psychological literature, this dynamic is referred to as transferrence and countertransference. In this dynamic, the patient projects their unment romantic and sexual desires onto the therapist. "

  '0x': `Dr Andy was instrumental in helping me overcome my findom addiction.`,
  '0x1': `I've cycled through more therapists than I can count, and it always left me feeling like I was the problem. How come therapy can fix so many people, but not me? Clearly this was my fault. It was my fault I couldn't be fixed, it was my fault that I was single, and it was my fault that I couldn't love myself. I was the failure. But things were different with Dr Andy. Their warm demeanor and understanding tone created the perfect non-judgemental environment for me to address and correct multiple behavioral issues.`,
  '0x1': `I always found the psychological component of any kink to be the hottest part. So imagine how excited I got at the idea of <em>findom therapy</em>. There's just something about the combination of using a website, having deep conversations with a robot about my psyche, and sending it money that create the perfect storm for absurdly powerful orgasms!`,

  // For some reason I find it's easier to open up to a robot than a real person. At least I don't have to worry about her judging me.
